# Dealership-Relational-Database

I designed a database management system for a  chain of stores that track complete details about inventory, employees, sales, and customers. Also, I considerd a comprehensive list which allows you to monitor all aspect of selling and ordering vehicles in all of your dealerships at the same time. companies customers are also able to submit an order through diffrente dealershio of the company. The employees are able sell vehicles located in London to the customer in Kitchener. ( one dealership can be the supplier of another dealership )
